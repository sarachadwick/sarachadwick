### Hello hello! ðŸŒ±

Here are some projects!
 - TAQueue: A rails app that allows students to enter a queue that teachers assistants can manage for the purposeo of tutoring help!
 - Stellar-Connections: A WIP SvelteKit project that dreams of being a Svelte/Typescript tutorial!
 - Bunbon2: A simple clicker game that I wrote with vanilla javascript as a new grad and ported to SvelteKit. That's growth, baby!
